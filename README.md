# Cplitzu keyboard

The Cplitzu Keyboard is a compact, ortholinear, 50-key split keyboard inspired by the [Let's split](https://github.com/nicinabox/lets-split-guide) and [Corne](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd) keyboards. It features a 3x6 ortholinear layout with an additional thumb key for improved ergonomics and functionality. Designed with ease of assembly in mind, it avoids the need for tiny SMD components, making it beginner-friendly for hand soldering.
